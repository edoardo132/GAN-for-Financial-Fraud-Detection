# GAN-for-Financial-Fraud-Detection


# General Adversarial Networks (GANs) for Financial Fraud Detection

## Introduction
Exploring the use of GANs to enhance fraud detection, leveraging two neural networks in competition to improve anomaly detection, data augmentation, and feature learning in financial transactions.

## Project Overview
- **Data Augmentation:** Generates synthetic yet realistic transaction data.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Identifies deviations from normal transaction patterns.
- **Feature Learning:** Enhances understanding of complex transaction characteristics.

## Dataset
Utilizes a synthetic dataset from the PaySim simulator, reflecting real transaction dynamics and fraudulent activities, available on Kaggle: [PaySim Synthetic Financial Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealaxi/paysim1).

## Objectives
Implement a basic GAN architecture to:
- Create synthetic data for fraud detection model training.
- Improve feature learning for accurate fraud transaction detection.
